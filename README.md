<strong>My take on the famous YelpCamp.</strong>
<br>
As my final project for the Udemy full-stack web developer bootcamp, I walked through the guided build of YelpCamp. If you're unfamiliar, seach for yelpcamp on github and you'll find many, but each one is different. This respository holds my take on the YelpCamp theme, with some unique features and  quirks that I hope you'll enjoy. 

If you're a current Udemy student, feel free to use this for inspiration and copy any part of it. Most of the images are mine, with the excpetion of a few on the LeaveNoTrace page that I snagged from unsplash. 

<strong>What's differnt about this one?</strong>
<br>
1. 
  - async refactor
  - profile pages
  - carousel
  - user management system
  - inline comment creation
  - Leave no trace

3. Visualizing the stack
  - image w. logos

4. Areas to explore
  - Make campground "description" more user friendly, ex: Highlight, Lowlight, Vibe check (1-10)
  - Cover image on profile pages
  - Refactor amenities route
  - Star ratings and reviews
  - Sorting on the index page
  - Map view for index

Images are mine, except for a few on the Leave no trace page, which are from upsplash. Feel free to use mine if you like them.
